# papermap_with_gps

Got the paper map and a phone but dont want to subscribe to an expensive app to get online maps that work with a GPS?
Scan the paper map and load the jpeg file into this app. Calibrate the map to the GPS via the app (by specifying two points on the map and their actual coordinates in digital degrees).
Voila! you can use the app to show where on the map you are. 

Note that accuracy will depend on how to scale your map is, whether the image has been distorted during scanning and how accurate the points are that the map has been calibrated to - Google maps is very accurate for road junctions for example.

This app was created prior to completing the Tour du Mont Blanc - I had bought the excellent Cicerone IGN maps and Guide book but wanted to show the paper maps on my phone along with my position.
